## Project Overview

This project demonstrates my knowledge of the Flask framework and other technologies by developing an AI-based web application for an e-commerce company. The Emotion Detection system processes customer feedback in text format to identify emotions such as joy, sadness, and anger. This advanced form of sentiment analysis is crucial for AI-based recommendation systems, automated chatbots, and more.

### Tasks and Objectives
- Packaged the application for distribution.
- Implemented and executed unit tests to ensure functionality and reliability.
- Deployed the application as a web service using Flask.
- Incorporated robust error handling to manage potential issues.
- Performed static code analysis to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Flask**: Framework for deploying the web application.
- **Watson NLP**: IBM's library for emotion detection.
- **HTML/CSS**: For front-end development.
- **UnitTest**: For creating and running unit tests.
- **Requests**: For making API requests to Watson NLP services.
- **JSON**: For data interchange between the client and server.
